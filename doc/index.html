            <h1>reMamba</h1>

            <p>For my final project I've chosen to remake old windows95 game called Mamba. A long time ago I used to play it a lot with my family when I had my first computer. We had a really good time playing it.</p>

            <p>I had chosen it as a game for my 3rd assignment but during programming process I realized, that it is quite more complex than I expected. So I didn't make it to return it, but anyway still I want to get it done. </p>

            <h1>origins</h1>

            <p>Original game was called mamba.exe. I wasn't able to find more
            about this game on the internet, only one picture. I'm
            trying to remake it mostly by my memories. This is how original game looks like. </p>

            <h2>about</h2>

            <p>The principle of a game is pretty simple. You are a little spider in a jungle and there is a big mamba snake which is trying to eat you. Every time you enter the danger area, you weave a cobweb. Of course mamba doesn't like it and is trying to eats you or to destroy your web until you reach the safe zone. You can win only when you occupy with your web more than 80% of area. With every level mamba gets more faster and smarter. </p>
